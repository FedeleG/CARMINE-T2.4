The FWI is based on daily variables from EMO1 data (info https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/0bd84be4-cec8-4180-97a6-8b3adaac4d26) 

Calculating FWI at 60" spatial resolution 
1. Noon temperature is calculated from daily max and min temperatures using Sin (14R-1) method8 
2. Wind speed is limited to 15m/s to avoid wind speed outliers in EMO1.
3. Relative humidity is calculated from vapor pressure and temperature using the August-Roche-Magnus formula.
