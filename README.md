# CARMINE-T2.4
This is the GitHub repository set up for the implementation of post-processing tools for calculating climate indicators.

The repository is organized with a folder for each CSA, containing a .txt file to record progress. Within each folder, the python codes for each CSA will be developed.

Please comment with a small message every push you make, so it's easier to understand the modifications made

# Table with the indicators for every CSAs

| Prague | Leipzig | Funen-Odense | Athens | Barcelona | Bologna | Brasov | Birmingham |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|------------|
| Mean radiant temperature (MRT) | Fire risk occurrence levels for next day | Changes in windstorm intensity and frequency | Number of days with Tmin > 20°C | Maximum Temperatures | Annual cumulative precipitation | Hourly rainfall | Hourly rainfall |
| Thermal comfort indices (e.g. UTCI) | Extreme heat indicators | Changes in maximum daily/subdaily wind speed | Number of hot nights | Heatwave length | Maximum summer temperature | Hourly temperature | Monthly prec. > average |
| Air pollution concentration | Flood indicators |  | Number of hot days | SPI, SPEI | Average annual temperature | SPI | Indicators on vegetation |
| Air temperature |  |  | Maximum duration of heat waves | Consecutive dry days | Tropical night | Summer Days | Accumulated degree days above threshold for tree species |
| Surface temperature |  |  | CCDs | Fire weather index | CDDs | UTCI | SPI |
